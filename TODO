* Mapview should be using a matrix(square array) instead of list for the tiles. easier to handle
* sort + filtering
* regen all previews
* parallize reading jpg
* cleanup reading of matrix data (the camera specific XYZ translation matrices)
* move files related to DB to DataAccess dir instead of Workunits
* add logging to regen hash/regen previews so that we can tell which images are missing
* improve speed by loading image in memory once and then passing ByteArray instead of files (Import Previews, Generating Thumbs)
* clicking on empty space in tileview should deselect all selections.
* clicking inside a selection should not clear the selection but just change the current index within the selection
* decouple LoupeView from PhotoStage (= remove dependency on Photo)
* fixedlistview fixedtreeview, recalculate after remove+add rows
* redo reading Color Profile name and assigning it to the ExifInfo + store in DB
* Any place where QImages are used. bits() or scanline(). avoid unnecessary buffer duplication
* engine/platform functions should not be C files but CPP files
* double check threading is parallized, instead of single thread that does sequential work
